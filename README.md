# AI Practice Projects 🚀

Welcome to your AI learning journey! This repository contains two simple, independent AI projects for practice purposes.

## 📁 Project Structure

- **`linear_regression_project/`** - House price prediction using basic ML
- **`neural_network_project/`** - Digit classification using deep learning

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- **Basic Machine Learning**: Linear regression, data handling, model training
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks, training process, image classification
- **Data Science**: Working with datasets, visualization, model evaluation
- **Python Programming**: Libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Navigate to any project folder
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the main Python file
4. Follow the README in each project folder

## 📚 Learning Path

Start with **Project 1** (Linear Regression) to understand basic ML concepts, then move to **Project 2** (Neural Network) for deep learning.

Happy coding! 🎉
